NeuroBench is an ongoing community effort towards defining benchmarks for neuromorphic algorithms and systems. 

Benchmarks are currently under construction and a public release of a benchmark harness and leaderboard for the algorithms track is end of Q2 2023, and for the systems track is end of Q4 2023. For more information, please see the [NeuroBench website](https://neurobench.ai/) and [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04640), and stay updated by joining the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/neurobench).
